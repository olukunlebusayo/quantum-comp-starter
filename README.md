# quantum-comp-starter
This is my starter project in quantum computing. Creating my first quantum computer similar to "hello world" in any programming language.
You will need qiskit library, steps for installation here --> https://qiskit.org
You will also need IBMQ Experience API to run your quantum program on a real quantum device. Get it here --> https://quantum-computing.ibm.com
All credit goes to qiskit for their amazing tutorials
